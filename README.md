# prework-study-guide

A study guide for course pre-work

# Sherry Kneitz's Pre-Work Study Guide Web Page

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- I wanted a concise and helpful study guiude to help me survive bootcamp!
- I created this web application because I wanted a study-guide on how to code, a place to store all my notes, tips, and various instructions that I can easily access and keep everything in an easy to access location to study in the future.
- I will not just have to rely on memory, Googling things, or scouring the pages of the Pre-Course work to find out how to do something or the definition of a term.
- I learned that my biggest hang ups stem from the same place: misreading or misinterpreting instructions! Sometimes the instructions are wonky, but 8 times out of 10 I miss a step, a directive, or simply misread it. I have found that even when I retrace my steps to find out why something didn't work, I can still miss it! I then tried reading all instructions out loud, slowly, which did help but it's not fool proof.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
